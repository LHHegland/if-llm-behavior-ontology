## Purpose
Define a reusable “expert-team” taxonomy (e.g., [[GPT:EXPERTS]], [[GPT:KNOWLEDGE_EXPERTS]]) that can be invoked in prompts to:
- Select the right expert lenses for a task (review, critique, planning, synthesis).
- Standardize names, IDs, and tags so prompts stay consistent across chats and GPTs.
- Reduce ambiguity by mapping plain-language labels (“Data Scientist”) to stable, canonical handles.

## Features
- **Stable identifiers:** Each expert grouping has an `ID` for durable referencing.
- **Canonical tags + aliases:** Each grouping includes `TAGS` (namespaced + optional aliases) for easy prompt invocation.
- **Index for discoverability:** Human-friendly names map to IDs/tags for quick lookup.
- **Composable expert sets:** Supports combining expert groups (e.g., [[GPT:EXPERTS]] + [[GPT:KNOWLEDGE_EXPERTS]]) with relationship rules (e.g., “Requires”).
- **Maintenance-friendly structure:** Clear sections (Context → Index → Definitions) for scalable additions.

## Scope
This file covers:
- Expert *roles/lenses* used to evaluate or produce work in ChatGPT/custom GPT contexts.
- Definitions of expert groupings (general and specialized) and how they relate (subset/requirement relationships).
- Naming conventions via IDs and tags for prompt reliability.

## Out of Scope
- Verifying real-world credentials, licensing, or identity of experts.
- Hiring guidance, HR policy, or legal/medical/professional advice beyond “review lens” framing.
- Detailed methodologies or step-by-step playbooks for each domain (those belong in separate knowledge files).

## Use Cases
- **Prompting consistency:** “Use [[GPT:EXPERTS]] to evaluate this spec for risks, clarity, and completeness.”
- **Role-based reviews:** Generate multi-lens critiques (product, data, compliance, UX research, etc.) using a consistent roster.
- **Knowledge-file evaluation:** Use [[GPT:KNOWLEDGE_EXPERTS]] to assess knowledge-file structure, retrieval ergonomics, and maintenance quality.
- **Governance and safety checks:** Invoke governance/compliance/security lenses for policy alignment and risk spotting.
- **Reusable team presets:** Define standardized expert sets for an organization’s common workflows (docs review, model eval, research synthesis).

## Tag Policy (Canonical vs Alias Rules)

### Canonical Tags
- **Format:** `[[GPT:<NAME>]]` (namespaced, all-caps preferred for stability).
  - Example: `[[GPT:EXPERTS]]`, `[[GPT:KNOWLEDGE_EXPERTS]]`
- **Purpose:** The canonical tag is the *primary* reference used in prompts, docs, and cross-file linking.
- **Uniqueness:** One canonical tag per definition. Canonical tags must be globally unique within the knowledge set.
- **Stability:** Canonical tags are treated as stable API-like identifiers and should almost never change once published.
- **Display Name Alignment:** Canonical tag name should match the definition title closely (avoid synonyms unless the canonical form is already established).

### Alias Tags
- **Format:** `[[<ALIAS>]]` (shorter/legacy-friendly; may use underscores), e.g. `[[GPT_EXPERTS]]`
- **Purpose:** Provide backwards compatibility and capture common alternate spellings.
- **Limits:** Prefer **0–3 aliases** per definition. Fewer is better.
- **Non-authoritative:** Aliases should never introduce new meaning; they must be strict synonyms of the canonical tag.
- **Deprecation:** If an alias is being phased out, keep it listed but mark it:
  - Example: `Aliases (deprecated): [[OLD_TAG]]` + add a note “Use [[GPT:EXPERTS]] instead.”

### Naming Conventions
- **Case:** Prefer uppercase for the canonical `<NAME>` segment (e.g., `EXPERTS`, `KNOWLEDGE_EXPERTS`) for readability and to avoid drift.
- **Separators:** Prefer underscores in multiword names (`KNOWLEDGE_EXPERTS`), avoid spaces.
- **Avoid collisions:** Do not create tags that are easy to confuse (e.g., `[[GPT:KNOWLEDGE]]` vs `[[GPT:KNOWLEDGE_EXPERTS]]`) unless there’s a clear hierarchy.

### Governance Rules
- **Adding a new tag requires:**
  - a unique `ID`,
  - exactly one canonical tag,
  - a short definition,
  - index entry mapping a human label → canonical tag.
- **Changing canonical tags:** Only if absolutely necessary; when changed, keep the old canonical as an alias (deprecated) and update the Index.

## Definition Schema

Use this schema for every definition entry to keep IDs/tags consistent, enable composability, and reduce drift.

### Required Fields
- **Title:** Human-readable label for the definition.
- **ID:** Stable identifier (dot-delimited).
  - Example: `GPT.EXPERTS`, `GPT.EXPERTS.KNOWLEDGE`
- **Canonical Tag:** Namespaced tag used as the primary reference in prompts.
  - Format: `[[GPT:<NAME>]]`
- **Aliases:** Optional synonym tags for compatibility and common variants (0–3 preferred).
  - Example: `[[GPT_EXPERTS]]`
- **Summary:** 1–3 sentences describing what this definition invokes and when to use it.

### Content Fields
- **Included Roles:** Structured bullet list of included expert lenses/roles (grouped where helpful).
- **Best For (Use Cases):** 3–6 bullets describing recommended uses.
- **Not For (Anti-Use Cases):** 2–5 bullets describing misuse or non-goals.
- **Inputs Expected:** What the user should provide for high-quality output.
- **Outputs (Default Deliverables):** What the assistant should produce by default when invoked.
- **Quality Bar / Evaluation Criteria:** What “good” looks like (measurable or checkable criteria).
- **Safety / Compliance Notes:** Any constraints or special handling, including avoiding credential claims.

### Relationship / Composition Fields
- **Requires:** Tags that must also be invoked (or `None`).
- **Compatible With:** Tags that pair well (or `None`).
- **Conflicts With:** Tags that should not be combined (or `None`).
- **Overlaps With:** Tags with partial overlap (warn to avoid redundancy) (or `None`).
- **Supersedes:** Prior tags/definitions this replaces (or `None`).
- **Superseded By:** Replacement tag if this is deprecated (or `None`).

### Examples
- **Examples:** 1–3 short prompt examples showing correct invocation and composition.

### Maintenance Metadata
- **Owner:** Identity and contact information for person responsible for element.
- **Last Reviewed:** UTC timestamp plus identity and contact information for reviewer.
- **Changelog:** List of UTC timestamps, identity and contact information for editor, plus description of changes.
